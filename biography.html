                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>With over 135 million streams to his name, Myles Smith, singer songwriter and DIY phenomenon extraordinaire, has released his debut ep ‘You Promised A Lifetime’.</p>
              
              <p>Born in Luton, Myles, a guitar player from the age of nine, is the man behind streaming sensations ‘Solo’ and ‘My Home’. Over the last year, his profile has sky-rocketed as he’s released a string of original tracks and captivating covers that mix folk, americana and pop. His dedicated fanbase is evident, with 135 million streams, over 600k followers on Instagram, 6.3 million monthly listeners on Spotify and almost 850k followers on TikTok.</p>
              
              <p>Myles said of his debut EP: "This title represents a profound, yet neutral statement, which gains meaning through the perspective of the person reading it. With the project, my own stories, and the stories of those around me were used to create it, but it’s the stories and journeys of those listening who truly give it life, depending on where you are in life and what you are feeling. I hope it gives space to people to unlock their own meanings.""</p>
              
              <p>Myles has also announced his second headline tour in the form of a string of Spring dates in the UK and EU. It’s hot off the heels of his first sold out UK/EU and US tour – which saw his army of fans singing every word to every song.</p>
